- This is an internal only testsuite meant for unit testing support of crypto operations

- Requirements
littlefs-python (https://pypi.org/project/littlefs-python/) to generate a filesystem on the host and littlefs support on the target

- How are test and data files generated
We are reusing files from mbedtls-testsuite over here. 
For every new version update these files should be updated.

Steps to generate files:
1. cd mbedtls/example/mbedtls_testsuite/tests
2. python generate_test_files.py -t [test_suite_xxx.data]

The mbedtls tooling generates a *.c file + a *.datax file for the selected testsuite. They are postprocessed 
and converted/embedded in a littlefs binray file.

Step 2 generates test_suite_postprocessed.c and the corresponding test_suite_postprocessed.datax.littlefs.bin.
The .c file is part of the build process (an example for one test suite is committed), the *.littlefs.bin file 
needs to be transferred to the target manually. The destination address needs to match the one that the c 
file is expecting it at. For example after building the following jlink commands could be used to transfer the
application as well as the test vectors to the target:

    si 1
    speed 4000
    halt
    loadfile armgcc\flash_debug\sdk20-app.bin 0x08000000
    loadfile ..\..\..\..\middleware\mbedtls\example\mbedtls_testsuite\tests\test_suite_postprocessed.datax.littlefs.bin 0x08100000
